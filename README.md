# Currently...
Hi, I'm (still) Gabriel Pinochet-Soto.
- Fifth year PhD candidate in Mathematical Sciences at PSU (PDX, OR).
- Bachelor's and Master's in Mathematics from PUCV (Valparaiso, Chile).
- Former ANL intern, current LLNL intern.

## Feaured in...
- [My personal PSU website](https://web.pdx.edu/~gpin2/) (cf., [my personal sites repo](https://github.com/homeomorfismo/sites))
- [YAMB](https://homeomorfismo.github.io) (i.e., my personal blog)
- [IMA Numerics' Former Members](https://sites.google.com/view/ima-numerics/home)
- [RTG in CADES](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/rtg-in-cades)
- [Secretary of PDX SIAM Chapter 2021 - 2023](https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/siampdx/home)

among other minor appearances (my website should have more info!)

## Things that I like...
- Scientific computing for FEM, numerical linear algebra, optimization (C++ and Python; MATLAB to a lesser extent recently).
- Autodifferentiation tools (Enzyme AD, JAX, PyTorch)
- Learning about other frameworks/tools/languages (Julia, LLVM IR, a _dash_ of TypeScript, Typst, etc.)
- Other topics (LCTVS, complexity theory, approximation theory for ML, etc.)
